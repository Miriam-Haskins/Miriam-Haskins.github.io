    <p>
      Life today is stressful. With media blaring <b>"bad news! bad news!"</b> everywhere we look, it can be hard sometimes to remember that there is any good in the world at all. But there is! There is always good somewhere in the world! But it's never given enough media attention. That's what I here at SmallWorld am trying to fix. Every day, there will be good news posted here, whether that be a new meme, the release of a new movie or video game, or a simple good thing that happened. You can later submit your own good news here too!
