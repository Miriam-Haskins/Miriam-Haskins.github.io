      Life today is stressful. With media blaring "bad news! bad news!" everywhere we look, it can be hard sometimes to remember that there is any good in the world at all. But there is! There is always good somewhere in the world! But it's never given enough media attention. That's what I here at SmallWorld am trying to fix. Every day, there will be good news posted here, whether that be a new meme, the release of a new movie or video game, or a simple good thing that happened. Also featured will be kindness tips, self-care ideas, and the like! You can later submit your own good news here too!

   Hi there SmallWorlders! Today is a good day to have a good day!
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <b>GOOD THING:</b> I'm coding this website on GitHub, so that's a good thing! It doesn't look too good right now, but I will update it frequently!
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <b>KINDNESS TIP: Smile at a stranger</b> If you see people on a regular basis (i.e. people in your classes at school, people who ride the same bus to work, coworkers, etc) that you don't know that well (or even that you hate), say "Hi" and smile when you see them! You might get weird looks, but hey, it's worth it!
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <b>KINDNESS TIP: Sharing is caring</b> I know that's a cliche, but it's really true! If you have an extra umbrella in the rain, an extra sandwich when someone's hungry at your office, or even just a smile to spare, the effect of one small action can change someone's world.
  </p>
   
   <p>
    <b>SELF-CARE TIP: Kindness Jar</b> I've heard this being used as an incentive program to be nice to others, but I suggest it as being nice to yourself. Every time you have a happy thought, memory, or idea, write it down and put it in a jar. When you're feeling down, pick a paper at random and pull it out. You'll be reminded of that happy thought, and it'll help you feel better!
   </p>
 <p>
  <b>VIDEO OF THE DAY: Corgis being adorable</b> We all know YouTube can lead to some really dark places. Enjoy this ray of fuzzy joy from the darkness! (Also yes, I'm 100% obsessed with the little fuzzy furballs. Best dog breed, FIGHT ME üò°.)
